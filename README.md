i3lock-fancy
============

i3lock script that takes a screenshot of the desktop, blurs and darken the background and adds a lock icon and text. I modified the original script (by meskarune): this version can accept a custom text as an input, if no text is provided it applyes the default "type password to unlock"

Depends:
* [i3lock-color-git](https://github.com/eBrnd/i3lock-color)
* imagemagick
* scrot
* Digital Tech font (included)
